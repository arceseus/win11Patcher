    <strong>win11Patcher</strong></br>
    <strong>Superseded by other tools, such as Rufus (https://rufus.ie).</strong></br>
    <strong>Going forward this project will still be worked on.</strong>
</p>


### Overview
win11Patcher is a foss patcher in Batchfile for Windows Users to bypass Windows 11 Restrictions. To download the project, go [here](https://github.com/revisitable/win11Patcher/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Run `win11Patcher.bat` as **Administrator**.<br/>
This project is still a work in progress. Due to my depression, I can't find the motivation to sit around and consistently work on projects with a somewhat set freetime anymore. Please don't expect an active maintainence on this project. Commits will be made at my own pace.. Furthermore, there's plenty of alternatives already out there that *don't* break licenses, should check them out.<br/>
**Thank you.**<br/>
